# Phase 2: Advanced Features

This phase builds upon the core functionality by adding advanced features for security, productivity, and personalization.

1.  **Implement end-to-end encryption**: 
    *   Create an encryption service using the `encrypt` package with AES-GCM.
    *   Store encryption keys securely, potentially using `flutter_secure_storage`.

2.  **Develop sticky notes and mind maps**: 
    *   Create a feature for users to add rich-text sticky notes.
    *   Build a mind-mapping tool with a drawable interface for organizing ideas.

3.  **Build personal routine and reminders**: 
    *   Implement a routine customizer with daily reminders.
    *   Add progress tracking (e.g., 50% complete).
    *   Implement recurring tasks.
