# Phase 1: Core Functionality
    *   Create a `Chat` screen and a service to send and receive messages.
    *   Add a chat feature for real-time communication within projects using Cloud Firestore.
4.  **Implement real-time chat**: 

    *   Manage the state of projects and tasks.
    *   Create data models for `Project`, `Task`, and `Subtask`.
    *   Implement the main screens for viewing projects and tasks.
3.  **Develop project and task management**: 

    *   Create a service to handle user sign-up and sign-in using Firebase Authentication.
    *   Create authentication screens (login, registration).
2.  **Implement user authentication**: 

    *   Add initial dependencies to `pubspec.yaml` for state management (`flutter_bloc`), data persistence (`hive`), and backend services (`firebase_core`, `cloud_firestore`).
    *   Create a scalable folder structure for features (e.g., `lib/src/features/...`).
1.  **Set up project structure and add dependencies**: 

This phase focuses on building the foundational features of the Tasker application.
